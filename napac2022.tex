\begin{abstract}
No simulation of intense beam transport has accurately reproduced measurements at the level of beam halo. One potential explanation of this discrepancy is a lack of knowledge of the initial distribution of particles in six-dimensional (6D) phase space. A direct 6D measurement of an ion beam was recently performed at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Beam Test Facility (BTF), revealing nonlinear transverse-longitudinal correlations in the beam core that affect downstream evolution. Unfortunately, direct 6D measurements are limited in resolution and dynamic range; here, we discuss the use of three slits and one screen to measure a 5D projection of the 6D phase space distribution, overcoming these limitations at the cost of one dimension. We examine the measured 5D distribution before and after transport through the BTF and compare to particle-in-cell simulations. We also discuss the possibility of reconstructing the 6D distribution from 5D and 4D projections.

\section{Introduction}

The phase space distributions of intense beams tend to develop halo — a low density region far from the beam core — during low-energy transport \cite{Batygin2021}. The existence of beam halo at higher energies leads to uncontrolled losses that limit the performance of high-power accelerators \cite{Henderson2014}. Attempts to reproduce measurements at the halo level in computer simulation have been unsuccessful \cite{Allen2002, Qiang2002, Groening2008}, likely due to an inaccurate initial distribution of particles in 6D phase space.

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Beam Test Facility (BTF) is poised to resolve these discrepancies. The BTF is a replica of the front-end of the SNS linac — the H$^-$ ion source, 65 keV low-energy beam transport (LEBT), 402.5 MHz radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and 2.5 MeV medium energy beam transport (MEBT) — followed by a twenty-cell FODO transport line \cite{Zhang2020}. There are two emittance measurement stations: one in the MEBT (1.3 meters downstream of the RFQ) and one after the FODO line. The two-dimensional (2D) horizontal and vertical phase space distributions can be measured at either station with a dynamic range above $10^6$ \cite{Aleksandrov2021}, large enough to image the beam halo \cite{Aleksandrov2020}. The 6D phase space distribution can be measured at the first station \cite{Cathey2018}. 

One goal of the research program at the BTF is to reproduce the measured halo at the second emittance station in simulation. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to generate a realistic initial bunch due to the limited resolution (10 points per dimension) and dynamic range ($10^1$) of 6D measurements.\footnote{A 6D measurement with these parameters took over thirty-two hours in \cite{Cathey2018} but has been reduced to twenty-four hours with improved data acquisition software.} Improvements to the scan efficiency are under development; in this paper, we consider the use of three slits and one screen to measure a 5D projection of the 6D phase space distribution, overcoming these limitations at the cost of one dimension. We examine the measured 5D distribution at both emittance stations and discuss how the measurements might contribute to the goal of halo prediction at the BTF.

\section{Measurements of the initial distribution in the BTF}

The measurement apparatus in Fig.~\ref{fig:5dmeas} consists of two vertical slits to select the horizontal position $x$ and momentum $x'$, a vertical slit to select the vertical position $y$, and a scintillating screen after a dipole bend. The vertical momentum $y'$ is linearly related to the vertical position on the screen; the energy deviation $w$ is a function of the horizontal position on the screen and the $x$ and $x'$ selected by the upstream slits. The scan consists of a series of "sweeps" where the vertical slits are held fixed while the horizontal slit moves at a fixed speed, collecting the image on the screen on every beam pulse at a 5 Hz repetition rate. A rectilinear scan pattern is employed with a linear correlation between $x$ and $x'$ to align the grid with the $x$-$x'$ distribution. The data is linearly interpolated onto a regular grid after transforming to phase space coordinates.

\subsection{Revisiting hidden features in the beam core}

We first examine the measured 5D distribution at the first emittance station. 57,766 images were collected over 4.9 hours as the slits traversed a $32 \times 32 \times 32$ grid. The beam current during the measurement was stable at 30.6 mA. Fig.~\ref{fig:VS06_corner} shows the 1D and 2D projections of the measured 5D phase space distributions. The density profiles vary smoothly in all projections and there are no visible inter-plane correlations.

Previous high-dimensional measurements of the beam exiting the RFQ have revealed nonlinear transverse-longitudinal correlations in the beam core: the energy and phase distribution of particles at the center of transverse phase space ($x \approx x' \approx y \approx y' \approx 0$) is hollow and bimodal while the full projection is unimodal \cite{Cathey2018}. This is a space-charge-driven effect \cite{Ruisard2021-hollow} and has a clear dependence on the beam intensity. The relationship between the energy and transverse coordinates was examined by slicing the distribution in the transverse plane before projecting the distribution onto the energy axis; i.e., by inserting slits upstream of the longitudinal emittance measurement diagnostic. The five-dimensional nature of the correlation is made clear by observing the energy profile as each dimension is sliced. We repeat this for our 5D measurement in Fig.~\ref{fig:hollow_a}.

Slicing the array in this way selects only a small fraction of the beam particles — vanishingly small when three or four dimensions are sliced — and does not characterize the extent of the hollow-energy core in the full transverse phase space. This information is encoded in the 5D measurement: Fig.~\ref{fig:hollow_b} plots the energy distribution within a shrinking volume of transverse phase space. For each threshold $t$, we project the 5D array $f_{5D}$ along the $w$ axis to obtain $f_{4D}$, normalize the elements of $f_{4D}$ to the range $[0, 1]$, locate the indices $\left\{i, j, k, l\right\}$ such that $f_{4D}[i, j, k, l] < t$, and mask these indices in $f_{5D}$ before projecting $f_{5D}$ onto the $w$ axis. A hollow energy distribution begins to emerge at the $10^{-1}$ contour.

\subsection{Reconstructing the 6D distribution from 5D and 4D projections}

The effect of hidden high-dimensional features on halo formation and long-term beam dynamics is not yet known due to the lack of a realistic 6D simulation bunch.\footnote{
   Bunches produced by LEBT/RFQ simulations have qualitatively similar features to those seen in high-dimensional measurements, albeit large errors in the root-mean-square emittances. The simulated transport of these bunches through the SNS linac indicates that the correlations affect the root-mean-square beam sizes over time \cite{Ruisard2021-IPAC}.
} The present resolution and dynamic range of direct 6D measurements are too low to capture these features. It is therefore prudent to determine whether the 6D distribution can be recovered from the high-resolution, relatively high-dynamic-range 5D measurements described herein. The problem can be formulated as follows, letting $z$ and $z'$ be the longitudinal phase space coordinates: construct $f(x, x', y, y', z, z')$ consistent with the measured $f(x, x', y, y', z')$ and $f(x, x', z, z')$, where the latter is measured using two vertical slits and a BSM \cite{Ruisard2020}. 

We suggest several approaches here. A naive solution would be to set $f(x, x', y, y', z, z') = f(x, x', y, y', z') f(z)$; however, this assumes no correlation between $z$ and $z'$, which are strongly correlated in reality. A simple but promising approach is to generate a 5D particle distribution, then add the $z$-$z'$ correlation ``by hand", assuming $z \approx az' + \Delta$ where $a$ is a constant and $\Delta$ is a small random variable. This will be our first attempt.

More interesting is the case of an arbitrary $z$ distribution. An almost identical problem has been encountered in astrophysics: the Gaia satellite has measured the phase space coordinates of many stars in the Milky Way galaxy, but a large fraction of the measurements contain only five of the six coordinates; neural networks have been employed to infer the missing velocity coordinate \cite{Dropulic2021}. Another approach is to treat the problem as a tomographic image reconstruction. For example, the Maximum Entropy (MENT) algorithm could be used, which selects the maximum entropy image among those consistent with the measured projections \cite{Skilling1984}. It is unknown if MENT (or other image reconstruction algorithms) can easily scale from two to six dimensions.


\section{5D simulation benchmark}

While the 6D measurement can only be performed at the first emittance station, the 5D measurement can be performed at either emittance station. This provides a unique opportunity for a 5D simulation benchmark. We performed a scan at the second emittance station, collecting 220,783 images over 13.8 hours. The beam current was stable during the scan at 25.8 mA. This produced an interpolated phase space density array with dimensions $71 \times 104 \times 71 \times 110 \times 92$.\footnote{
    The measurement grid is sheared along the $x'$ axis, boosting the resolution along the second axis of the array. All images were downscaled by a factor of three using local averaging.
} Fig.~\ref{fig:VS34} compares the $x$-$x'$-$w$ distribution with a particle-in-cell simulation. The simulation was performed in the PyORBIT code with a 3D fast Fourier transform space charge solver on a $64\times 64 \times 64$ mesh with 10,000,000 macro-particles. The initial simulation bunch was generated by independently sampling 2D measurements such that $f(x,x',y,y',z,z') = f(x,x')f(y,y')f(z,z')$. The reasonable agreement in $x$-$x'$-$w$ space was expected from previous successful benchmarks of the $x$-$x'$ distribution in \cite{Ruisard2021-IPAC}. We do not display the vertical phase space here: there remain unresolved discrepancies in the vertical plane, perhaps due to unidentified quadrupole misalignments or an offset of the beam centroid. A detailed investigation of the measured 5D phase space distribution is reserved for a future publication.



\section{Conclusion}

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Beam Test Facility (BTF) has the ability to measure the full 6D phase space distribution of an intense ion beam. Such a measurement could lead to the accurate prediction of beam halo formation; however, the resolution and dynamic range of 6D measurements are currently too low to generate a realistic simulation bunch. 5D phase space measurements offer significant improvements in dynamic range and resolution. The 5D phase space distribution was measured at the first emittance station in the BTF. Hidden high-dimensional features in the beam core — previously measured only in small slices of the transverse phase space — were revisited in the 5D distribution. Several strategies to reconstruct the 6D distribution from the 5D measurement were suggested. Finally, the measured 5D phase space distribution at the end of the BTF was used to benchmark a particle-in-cell simulation. Reasonable agreement was found in the 3D $x$-$x'$-$w$ space; disagreement remains in $y$-$y'$ space.
